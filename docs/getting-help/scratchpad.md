# Ideas to save

From my notes on <https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1128>

## Things I learned to tell users

Just to note, I am using Obsidian 1.3.1 (65) with Tasks 1.13.1 too, on iPad and iPhone, and getting plenty of results. So I am guessing that it is something specific about your setup.

Ideas to look at:

- make sure you have force-quit and restarted Obsidian, as this fixes a lot of issues, especially if Tasks has been updated.
- check that there are no double-spaces in any of the lines in the query
- check the settings in your mobile device - for Tasks' global filter
  - Is it possible that a global filter is enabled on desktop but not mobile?
  - The only time I have seen no tasks be found is in vaults where a global filter was enabled, and none of the tasks had the global filter in
- please find a specific task which matches the query on Desktop, and does not match the query on iPad/iPhone
  - and then copy and paste that task, exactly, in to this issue.

I am unaware of any way to see the Obsidian console on iPad/iPhone, which makes debugging hard.

- Check that your note really has been copied to the machine where you are not getting any results.
